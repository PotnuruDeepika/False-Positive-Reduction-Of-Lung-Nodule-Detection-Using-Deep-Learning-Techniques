# False-Positive-Reduction-Of-Lung-Nodule-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Techniques
CT scans of Lung nodules were taken and trained with the Transfer learning model of VGG 16 and identified that the given lung nodule is True Nodule or False Nodule and in the training process different augmentation techniques were performed.
